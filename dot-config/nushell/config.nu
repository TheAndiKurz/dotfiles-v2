# Note that this feature is dependent on the host OS trashcan support.

# cursor_shape_* (string)
# -----------------------
# The following variables accept a string from the following selections:
# "block", "underscore", "line", "blink_block", "blink_underscore", "blink_line", or "inherit"

# Apply to the Nushell completion system

# true: Partially complete up to the best possible match
# false: Do not partially complete
# Partial Example: If a directory contains only files named "forage", "food", and "forest",
#                  then typing "ls " and pressing <Tab> will partially complete the first two
#                  letters, "f" and "o". If the directory also includes a file named "faster",

# --------------------
# External Completions
# --------------------
# completions.external.*: Settings related to completing external commands
# and additional completers

# external.exnable (bool)
# true: search for external commands on the Path
# false: disabling might be desired for performance if your path includes
#        directories on a slower filesystem
$env.config.completions.external.enable = true

# max_results (int): Limit the number of external commands retrieved from
# path to this value. Has no effect if `...external.enable` (above) is set to `false`
$env.config.completions.external.max_results = 50

# completer (closure with a |spans| parameter): A command to call for *argument* completions
# to commands (internal or external). 
#
# The |spans| parameter is a list of strings representing the tokens (spans)
# on the current commandline. It is always a list of at least two strings - The 
# command being completed plus the first argument of that command ("" if no argument has
# been partially typed yet), and additional strings for additional arguments beyond
# the first.
#
# This setting is usually set to a closure which will call a third-party completion system, such
# as Carapace. 
#
# Note: The following is an over-simplified completer command that will call Carapace if it
# is installed. Please use the official Carapace completer, which can be generated automatically
# by Carapace itself. See the Carapace documentation for the proper syntax.

# Terminal Integration

#  of course, if there is a conflict between the Nushell and Terminal's implementation.

# use_kitty_protocol (bool):

# Note: This setting replaces the now deprecated `ls.show_clickable_links`

# true/false to enable/disable OSC 133 support, a set of several escape sequences which
# report the (1) starting location of the prompt, (2) ending location of the prompt,
# (3) starting location of the command output, and (4) the exit code of the command.

# originating with Final Term. These sequences report information regarding the prompt
# location as well as command status to the terminal. This enables advanced features in

# command vs. the output, collapsible output, or keybindings to scroll between prompts.

# bracketed_paste (bool):
# true/false to enable/disable the bracketed-paste feature, which allows multiple-lines

# Note that bracketed paste is not currently supported on the Windows version of
# Nushell.
$env.config.bracketed_paste = true

# use_ansi_coloring (bool):
