# My Powershell Dotfiles for Linux (I use ARCH btw.)

To install them just run `stow --dotfiles . --target=$HOME` while in the root of the directory.

## Powershell completions

If you have any Powershell completions then please, feel free to add them in the 
`dot-config/powershell/completions` directory and to the `index.ps1` in the root
of the completions folder (this index file loads all other completion files and is loaded
in the profile file).

Thanks to everyone who contributes powershell completions to this repo. 

o7 you are a hero!
